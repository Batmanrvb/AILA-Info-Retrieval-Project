# Introduction
In countries following the Common Law system (e.g., UK, USA, Canada, Australia, India), there are two primary sources of law – Statutes (established laws) and Precedents (prior cases).

● Statutes deal with applying legal principles to a situation (facts / scenario / circumstances which lead to filing the case).

● Precedents or prior cases help a lawyer understand how the Court has dealt with similar scenarios in the past, and prepare the legal reasoning accordingly.

# Motivation
When a lawyer is presented with a situation (that will potentially lead to filing of a case), it will be very beneficial to one if there is an automatic system that identifies a set of related prior cases involving similar situations as well as statutes/acts that can be most suited to the purpose in the given situation.

# Applications
Such a system shall not only help a lawyer but also benefit a common man, in a way of getting a preliminary understanding, even before he/she approaches a lawyer. It shall assist him/her in identifying where his/her legal problem fits, what legal actions he/she can proceed with (through statutes) and what were the outcomes of similar cases (through precedents).

Motivated by the above scenario, we propose two tasks here :
1. Identifying relevant prior cases for a given situation (Precedent Retrieval)
2. Identifying most relevant statutes for a given situation (Statute Retrieval)

**Domain** : This is a task in the domain of Natural Language Processing, Information Retrieval and Data Mining.
